## Errors

```plaintext
No operations defined in spec!
```

![Swagger](/images/swagger-no-operations-defined.png)

I don't think this is an error as such. But, if you can't see an endpoint here, you can probably see it in APIM:

And you can also check the endpoint like so:

```plaintext
localhost:58620/endpoint-name-here
```
