# GUIDs

GUID stands for **Globally Unique Identifier**. It's a unique reference number used as an ID in computer systems. 

The Guid type in .NET is a **128-bit integer (16 bytes)** that can be used across all computers and networks, wherever a unique identifier is required. Such an identifier has a very *low probability of being duplicated*.
