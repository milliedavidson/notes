# .NET

The **.NET runtime** is a code library which is *needed to run C# applications*. It's also referred to as the **Common Language Runtime (CLR)**. It's not required to *write* your code, but *is* required to  **run** your applications.

Check if .NET is installed and which version:

```bash
dotnet --version
```

Make a new .NET project:

```bash
dotnet new console -o /ProjectNameHere
```
