# Create a Web API in .NET

Following [this guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/first-web-api?view=aspnetcore-9.0&tabs=visual-studio) to build a Web API in .NET.

There are controller-based APIs and minimal APIs. This will be controller-based because that's what I use most at work.
